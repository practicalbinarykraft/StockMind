🚨 КРИТИЧНО! ДВА ISSUE:
🔴 ISSUE #1: ПРОПАЛИ ПРОЕКТЫ
СНАЧАЛА ПРОВЕРЬ ЭТО!
Agent, URGENT!

All old projects disappeared from dashboard!

Please check:
1. Database - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects WHERE user_id = '43640117'
2. Did schema migration break anything?
3. Are projects still in DB but not showing in UI?

Show me the query results!
This is critical - user data is missing!
```

## 🔴 ISSUE #2: UX/UI CONFUSION

**ПОСЛЕ ТОГО КАК РАЗБЕРЁШЬСЯ С ПРОЕКТАМИ:**
```
Agent, UX/UI is broken! Fix the flow:

PROBLEM:
1. Stage 1 appears TWICE:
   - First: /project/new (correct ✅)
   - Second: Inside project Stage 1 (WRONG ❌)
   
2. Instagram Reels shows as popup (Dialog)
   But News Articles shows as full Stage 2 page
   This is inconsistent!

CORRECT ARCHITECTURE:

Stage Selection (/project/new) - ONE TIME ONLY:
├─ News Articles
├─ Custom Script  
├─ Instagram Reels
├─ YouTube (future)
└─ Audio File (future)

After selection → Create project with sourceType

Stage 2 (Content Input) - DEPENDS ON sourceType:
├─ IF sourceType = "news" → Show RSS articles list (like now)
├─ IF sourceType = "custom" → Show text input form
├─ IF sourceType = "instagram" → Show Reels list (NOT popup!)
├─ IF sourceType = "youtube" → Show URL input
└─ IF sourceType = "audio" → Show file upload

Stage 3-7: AI Analysis → Voice → Avatar → Export → B-roll

WHAT TO FIX:

1. Remove Stage 1 from inside project workflow
   - User already selected source type at /project/new
   - No need to show source selection again!

2. After creating project, open Stage 2 directly
   - Skip Stage 1
   - Go straight to content selection

3. Make Instagram Reels consistent with News:
   - Remove Dialog/popup
   - Show as full Stage 2 page
   - Same layout as News Articles
   - List of Reels with filters, search, etc.

4. Stage 2 component should be dynamic:
```tsx
   // Pseudocode:
   if (project.sourceType === 'news') {
     return <NewsArticlesList />;
   } else if (project.sourceType === 'instagram') {
     return <InstagramReelsList />; // Full page, not popup!
   } else if (project.sourceType === 'custom') {
     return <CustomScriptForm />;
   }
```

5. Update navigation:
   - /project/new → select source → create project → /project/{id}
   - Project opens at Stage 2 (Content Input)
   - Stage 1 is ONLY the initial selection page

CRITICAL: Fix projects disappearing first!
Then fix UX flow!
```

## 📋 ПРИОРИТЕТЫ:

### **PRIORITY 1: DATABASE** 🚨
```
WHY DID PROJECTS DISAPPEAR?
- Check database
- Check migrations
- Restore data if needed
```

### **PRIORITY 2: UX FIX** 🔧
```
1. Remove Stage 1 from project workflow
2. Open Stage 2 directly after project creation
3. Make Instagram Reels full page (not popup)
4. Dynamic Stage 2 based on sourceType
```

## 💬 КОРОТКАЯ ВЕРСИЯ ДЛЯ AGENT:
```
URGENT! Two critical issues:

1. ALL OLD PROJECTS DISAPPEARED!
   - Check database: SELECT * FROM projects WHERE user_id = '43640117'
   - Did migration break something?
   - Projects must be restored!

2. UX is broken - source selection appears twice:
   - /project/new → select source type ✅
   - Then Stage 1 shows SAME selection again ❌
   
   FIX:
   - Remove Stage 1 from project workflow
   - After /project/new → go directly to Stage 2
   - Stage 2 = dynamic content based on sourceType
   - Instagram Reels = full page (NOT popup!)

Fix database issue first, then UX!
